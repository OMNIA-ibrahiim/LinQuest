## Question 1:

"Binka" the cat is working on a secret project about how to catch fish to eat them all by herself, without the other cats getting any information about that. However, she allows a few trusted cats, like "Lolly" to see the file. "Binka" needs to change the ownership of the "fishing_only_for_binka" file so that it's owned only by her and "Lolly", and nobody else should be able to read or modify the file.

Required:
"Binka" needs to modify the file's permissions so that only she and "Lolly" have access to it, with full control (read/write permissions), while all other cats should be denied any access. What commands should "Binka" use to change the file's ownership and permissions accordingly?
note: "Binka" does not prefer to deal with the binary system

"Binka" does not know how to create file , can you help her?


## Question 2:


"Lilo" found out about Binka's secret plan from "Lolly", and they decided to remove "Binka" as a user and make "Lolly" the owner of everything as a reward. They also agreed that they would allow all the other cats to see the contents of Binka's file so they could share the fish and eat them together. However, they are not prefer  working with characters and prefer working with numbers. They need help to add Lolly as a user and gain full control over Binka's file.

Required:
How can Lilo and Lolly remove "Binka" as a user and make Lolly the new owner of everything, including the "fishing_only_for_binka" file? Also, how can they ensure that all other cats can read the contents of this file?
