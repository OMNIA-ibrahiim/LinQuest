## Question 1:

"Binka" the cat is working on a secret project about how to catch fish to eat them all by herself, without the other cats getting any information about that. However, she allows a few trusted cats, like "Lolly" to see the file. "Binka" needs to change the ownership of the "fishing_only_for_binka" file so that it's owned only by her and "Lolly", and nobody else should be able to read or modify the file.

Required:
"Binka" needs to modify the file's permissions so that only she and "Lolly" have access to it, with full control (read/write permissions), while all other cats should be denied any access. What commands should "Binka" use to change the file's ownership and permissions accordingly?
note: "Binka" does not prefer to deal with the binary system

"Binka" does not know how to create file , can you help her?


## Question 2:


"Lilo" found out about Binka's secret plan from "Lolly", and they decided to remove "Binka" as a user and make "Lolly" the owner of everything as a reward. They also agreed that they would allow all the other cats to see the contents of Binka's file so they could share the fish and eat them together. However, they are not prefer  working with characters and prefer working with numbers. They need help to add Lolly as a user and gain full control over Binka's file.

Required:
How can Lilo and Lolly remove "Binka" as a user and make Lolly the new owner of everything, including the "fishing_only_for_binka" file? Also, how can they ensure that all other cats can read the contents of this file?

## Question 3:


"Kitty" the cat is collaborating with her friends on a project called "The Great Fish Heist". She wants to create a folder called "fish_heist" that she wants to share with the group "fish_lovers", but she doesnâ€™t want anyone outside the group to see the files. She also wants every member of the group to have read and write access.


Required:
How can "Kitty":
Change the ownership of the "fish_heist" folder to the group "fish_lovers"?
    Set permissions so that everyone in the group has read and write access, but no one outside the group can access it?

## Question 4:

"Misho" the cat was working on a project related to his school and decided to create a file to store information about his project, such as his name and year of study. After adding the information to the file, he wanted to set the file permissions so that only he could access it. However, when he tried to upload the file, he discovered that it was too large. He asked his teacher, "Loza" the cat, how to compress the file, but she didn't provide him with any details.
 Now, "Misho" is asking you how he can secure his file and how he can compress it to make it smaller in size
