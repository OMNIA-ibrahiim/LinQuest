### **Script Summary**  
This script sets up a **Linux-based treasure hunt game** inspired by *One Piece*. It creates **users, groups, directories, and files** with restricted permissions to challenge the player.  

1. **Creates Users & Groups:**  
   - Adds a group called `strawhats` and users `luffy` (player) and `keeper` (guardian of the stronghold).  
   - Sets passwords:  
     - **luffy:** `pirateking`  
     - **keeper:** `gatekeeper`  

2. **Sets Up Directories & Permissions:**  
   - `/laugh_tale/vault`: **Locked** (only `strawhats` group can enter).  
   - `/stronghold`: **Locked** (only `keeper` can access).  

3. **Places Hints & Challenges:**  
   - **Luffyâ€™s `README.txt`** (gives first challenge).  
   - **Inside `/stronghold/README.txt`** (hints at a hidden `.golden_key.zip` file).  
   - **Inside `/laugh_tale/vault/clue.txt`** (hints at a box key for the final treasure).  
   - **Final treasure (`one_piece`) is locked away.**

### **What Should the Player Do?**  
1. **Find a way to enter `/stronghold`** (since only `keeper` can access it).  
2. **Unlock and extract `.golden_key.zip`** to proceed.  
3. **Gain access to `/laugh_tale/vault`** using permissions or groups.  
4. **Find and use the box key to unlock the One Piece!**  

The player must **use Linux commands like `chmod`, `chown`, `groupmod`, and `sudo`** to progress through the game.
